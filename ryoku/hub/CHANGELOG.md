# Changelog: ryoku/hub/

## Unreleased

### Added
- A **Shell Settings** section: a live editor for the shell's look. **Frame** and
  **Island** tabs expose the knobs with the control each one wants, steppers with
  manual entry for exact pixels (radius, border, sizes, corners, gap), sliders for
  values tuned by eye (opacity, shadow strength, edge/bud melt), and a swatch with
  hex and dark presets for the surface colour, grouped under section headers. Every
  edit is applied to the running shell at once by writing `~/.config/ryoku/shell.json`
  (throttled, atomic), which the shell watches, so the preview is the actual desktop,
  the frame around the window and the island above it, not a mock pane. The action
  bar tracks the dirty state; Save keeps the look, Revert and leaving the section put
  the saved one back, and Reset to defaults restores the shipped values. A
  **Visualizer** tab tunes the desktop audio spectrum beside a live animated
  preview window: style (bars, wave, or dots), position (bottom, top, centre),
  shape (rounded or flat), mirror, on/off, band count, height, bar width, bloom,
  reflection, and the idle wave, writing `~/.config/ryoku/visualizer.json` the same
  live way. New `NumberField`, `SliderRow`, `Slider`, `ColorField`, `ToggleRow`,
  `ChoiceRow`, `SettingSection`, `VizPreview`, and `ShellSettingsPage` components.
- An Updates section wired to the `ryoku` CLI (`ryoku status --json`): a
  typographic status header (installed version, the pending-update count, and a
  live "checked Xm ago") over the real list of pending package updates (each
  `name old -> new`), with an automatic-check schedule in the top right (Off /
  Hourly / Daily / Weekly, persisted to the hub's TOML via an `update_interval`
  key) that re-runs the check on its cadence. "Update now" runs the real
  `ryoku update` in a terminal; the page mirrors its progress from the run-state
  file the CLI publishes (a spinner and a Ryoku wave while it applies), and the
  shell's update island reads the same file. A live count badge rides the nav
  rail. When the system is current there are no rows ("Everything is up to
  date") and the island stays hidden.
- Ryoku Hub: the desktop's central control center, a native Qt6/QML app
  (Quickshell, not a webview) with Kirigami-style sidebar navigation. Opened with
  `Super + ,`; it floats and centres on top of the current windows via a Hyprland
  window rule.
- `backend/` `ryoku-hub`, a Go data plane the QML shells out to: `ryoku-hub
  keybinds` parses the live Hyprland binds (`~/.config/hypr/modules/binds.lua`,
  the single source of truth) into categorised JSON, prettifying key tokens and
  deriving descriptions from each bind's comment or dispatcher; `ryoku-hub config
  get|set` persists hub state as TOML at `~/.config/ryoku/hub.toml` (atomic
  write), starting with the last open section.
- `quickshell/` the UI: a `FloatingWindow` with a navigation rail and a content
  area. The **Keybinds** section is functional, rendering the full shortcut
  legend as a flat list (ember section headers with a hairline rule, mechanical
  keycaps). **Extras** is under construction (its controls will likely use GTK4 +
  libadwaita through the Kirigami addons).
- A global fuzzy finder in the sidebar, focused with `Ctrl + K`. It searches
  content across every section: fuzzy-ranked keybinds (tagged with their
  category) and matching section names you can jump to. The matcher is a small
  subsequence scorer in `quickshell/fuzzy.js`.
- Visual language follows the shell: a deep warm canvas with the brand orange as
  the single deliberate accent, the 力 mark, JetBrains Mono keycaps, and the
  shell's morph motion (a single sliding selection indicator in the rail).

### Changed
- `backend/`: the keybind legend parser keeps lambda binds (multi-dispatch
  actions like `Super + A`, which floats and centres) in the legend, taking the
  description from the trailing comment, instead of dropping every bind whose
  action is not a bare `hl.dsp` expression.
- The **Updates** section tracks the git update channel (`main`) instead of pacman
  packages: the status header, the count badge, and the list show the commits the
  checkout is behind `origin/main` (subject + short hash), driven by the `channel`
  field `ryoku status --json` now publishes. "Up to date" shows when current.

### Fixed
- Ryoku Hub: `Super + ,` no longer goes dead after the hub is dismissed with the
  compositor's close (`Super + Q`). The keybind guards against a second instance
  with `flock` held for the life of the `qs -c hub` process; an external close
  only hid the window while the process kept running, pinning the lock so further
  presses silently no-opped. The `FloatingWindow` now quits on its `closed`
  signal, so every dismissal releases the lock.
