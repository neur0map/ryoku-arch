# Changelog: ryoku/

## Unreleased

### Added
- `hyprland/`: the Hyprland config in Lua, modular (entrypoint plus modules for
  input, decoration, animations, binds, window rules, ryoshot, and autostart)
  with hardware-managed gpu/keyboard/monitors. Launches the Ryoku shell and the
  laptop-only idle policy.
- `lockscreen/`: the vendored qylock clockwork theme, its installer, and the SDDM
  setup.
- `apps/`: kitty, fastfetch (with the branded wrapper), fish (greeting off),
  starship, and nautilus notes.
- `assets/`: the 力 brand logo and icons, plus the shipped wallpaper collection
  (`wallpapers/`) that installs to `~/Pictures/Wallpapers`; `ryoku-shell` picks a
  random one on first login.
- `shell/`: the Quickshell desktop UI (pill, sidebar, ryoshot),
  the wallust palette generation, the qt/kde theme, the user session target, and
  the `ryoku-shell` Go control-plane daemon (`ipc/`).
- `hyprland/` autostart and `shell/ipc`: apply wallust colors to
  OpenRGB-compatible keyboards and lighting devices through `ryoku-leds`.
- `hyprland/` autostart: set GTK apps to dark through `gsettings`
  (`color-scheme` prefer-dark, `gtk-theme` Adwaita-dark), so nautilus and other
  GTK apps match the dark Qt and kitty theme.
- `hyprland/` binds and autostart: hold ``Super+` `` for Handy speech-to-text and the
  live mic wave (`ryoku-shell voice start|stop`); autostart Handy hidden and
  tray-less (it is keybind-driven and configured from app search) when the
  optional `handy` binary is installed.

### Changed
- Tuned Hyprland window decoration and motion for the Ryoku shell: stronger
  shadows, softer translucency, wider breathing room, and branded open/close
  curves.
- Consolidated everything under a single `ryoku/` tree: the former top-level
  `shell/` now lives at `ryoku/shell/`, its modular Hyprland config replaced the
  old flat `ryoku/hyprland` (one Hyprland config now), and the duplicate
  `shell/fish` (with its non-brand greeting) was dropped for `ryoku/apps/fish`.
