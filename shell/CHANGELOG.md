# Changelog: shell/

## Unreleased

### Added
- The Ryoku desktop shell, imported and reorganized into this tree: the Quickshell
  UI (`pill` bar, `sidebar`, `topbar`, `launcher`, `ryoshot`), the Hyprland
  config in Lua, wallust palette generation, and the per-app configs.
- `ipc/`: `ryoku-shell`, a single Go program that is the shell's control plane.
  `ryoku-shell daemon` supervises the Quickshell components (restarting them if
  they exit), brings up the clipboard-history watchers and the wallpaper, and
  serves one Unix socket. `ryoku-shell <command>` is the client the Hyprland
  keybinds call. It resolves the active monitor itself and fans out to the
  Quickshell IPC, the wallpaper daemon and wallust, and qylock for the lock.
- `dev-run.sh`, `dev-stop.sh`, `dev-binds.sh`: run the shell from this checkout on
  a live Hyprland session via `RYOKU_SHELL_DIR` (`qs -p`), with quickshell
  hot-reload, so it can be developed without installing anything.

### Changed
- Replaced the per-component daemon and toggle shell scripts with the Go IPC: the
  `*-daemon.sh` watchdogs, `cliphist-watch.sh`, and the `launcher`/`sidebar`/
  `clipboard`/`link`/`lock`/`wallpaper`/`wallpaper-picker` scripts are gone. The
  keybinds (`binds.lua`), autostart (`autostart.lua`), and the QML that ran those
  scripts (the power menus, the wallpaper picker) now call `ryoku-shell`. Only the
  two leaf thumbnailers the UI invokes directly remain under `hypr/scripts/`.
- De-branded the import: no upstream name, attribution, or credits; `torii` ->
  `ryoku`, `rishot` -> `ryoshot`, and the matching file and directory renames.
  Removed the em-dashes from the QML display strings (the regex keeps splitting on
  one via an escape).
- Dropped the shell's own lock component; qylock (shipped by `ryoku/`) stays the
  lock, and `ryoku-shell lock` launches it.

### Not included
- The GRUB theme (the system boots with Limine) and the SDDM theme (a 38 MB
  third-party video, and the login screen is qylock). Bring either in later if
  wanted.
