# Changelog: installation/backend/

## Unreleased

### Added
- `ryoku-install` entrypoint: reads the `RYOKU_*` contract, runs the install end
  to end, and prints the `@@RYOKU_STEP` / `@@RYOKU_DONE` progress sentinels.
- `lib/` step helpers: `common`, `preflight`, `disk`, `luks`, `filesystem`,
  `pacstrap`, `chroot`, `deploy`, `drivers`, `bootloader`.
- `lib/deploy.sh`: deploys the desktop payload during the `configure` stage
  (GPU/monitor helper scripts, the GPU udev rule, brand assets, the user
  dotfiles, and the qylock bundle + SDDM clockwork theme), dry-run safe and
  tolerant of a partial repo.
- `lib/drivers.sh`: runs the per-vendor GPU driver scripts in the target during
  the `configure` stage, so each machine gets the generation-correct driver.
- `RYOKU_DRYRUN=1` mode: prints every destructive command (and file write)
  instead of running it, with secrets redacted, so the flow can be exercised
  without a disk.
- README documenting the contract, the progress protocol, and the dry-run mode.
