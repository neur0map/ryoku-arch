# map the UI names to ryoku-gpu's host graphics modes:
#   offload -> hybrid       (no pin; Hyprland's iGPU-first default, for battery)
#   sync    -> performance  (pin the dGPU as the primary renderer)
#   vfio    -> passthrough  (pin the iGPU alone, freeing the dGPU for a VM)
# run `ryoku-gpu mode <mapped>` as the user against their Hyprland pin file, via
# runuser like deploy.sh's materialize. ryoku-gpu's analyze reads /sys/class/drm,
# which arch-chroot bind-mounts, so detection sees the real target GPUs; the tool
# self-gates (a single GPU no-ops, a missing iGPU refuses passthrough), so a
# non-hybrid box is harmless. best-effort: a failure only skips the pin.
#
# config path = gpu.lua (GPU_CONF_DEFAULT), NOT user.lua. Hyprland autostart runs
# `ryoku-gpu persist` every login, which rewrites gpu.lua ONLY when a discrete
# pin is "beneficial" (see ryoku-gpu-detect beneficial(): an eGPU, or a DESKTOP
# whose strongest GPU is discrete). on the hybrid LAPTOP this feature targets,
# persist is NOT beneficial, so it leaves gpu.lua alone and our pick survives.
# gpu.lua is also the single file the Hub GPU page, `ryoku doctor`, and `ryoku
# materialize` all manage; user.lua would survive persist on every box but the
# Hub can neither see nor rewrite it, stranding the mode as an override no tool
# owns (a worse trap than the desktop/eGPU re-pin, which the Hub still governs).
